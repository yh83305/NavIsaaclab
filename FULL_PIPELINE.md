# Full Isaac Lab PPO pipeline

The repository provides two complementary training paths:

1. `src/crowdsim_ppo/`: a simulator-free reference pipeline for quickly reading
   and testing the algorithm.
2. `CrowdSim/` + `protomotions/`: the original Isaac Lab crowd-navigation
   pipeline with humanoids, robot sensors, maps and differential-drive control.

Preference PPO additionally uses `CrowdSim/pref/`. Expert trajectory collection
uses the selected files under `CrowdSim/flow/`. PPO-specific tests and evaluation
utilities are included under `CrowdSim/tests/` and `CrowdSim/tools/`.

## External files

The following large or separately distributed files are intentionally not stored
in this Git repository:

- MaskedMimic checkpoint, normally
  `data/pretrained_models/masked_mimic/smpl/last.ckpt`
- motion file referenced by `CrowdSim/config/env.yaml`
- warehouse or other scene USD referenced by `CrowdSim/config/scenes/*.yaml`
- trained robot PPO and reward-model checkpoints

Put those files at the configured paths or update the YAML files. ProtoMotions
robot definitions and mesh assets required by its simulator backends are included
under `protomotions/data/assets/`.

Some media and USD files in the source checkout were available only as Git LFS
pointer files. Their pointer metadata is retained, but the corresponding binary
objects must be downloaded from the upstream ProtoMotions distribution when a
simulator configuration needs them.

## Environment

Use an Isaac Sim / Isaac Lab environment compatible with the versions listed in
`requirements_isaaclab.txt`. The provided entry points import the simulator before
PyTorch in the required order.

## Train

```bash
python CrowdSim/ppo/train_ppo.py \
  --env-config CrowdSim/config/env.yaml \
  --total-steps 5000000 \
  --headless
```

Resume:

```bash
python CrowdSim/ppo/train_ppo.py \
  --env-config CrowdSim/config/env.yaml \
  --resume output/crowdsim_robot_ppo/RUN/robot_ppo_latest.pt \
  --headless
```

Collect expert trajectories:

```bash
python CrowdSim/flow/collect_ppo_buffer.py \
  --env-config CrowdSim/config/collect/ppo.yaml \
  --ppo-ckpt output/crowdsim_robot_ppo/RUN/robot_ppo_latest.pt
```

Preference-reward fine-tuning:

```bash
python CrowdSim/ppo/train_ppo_finetune.py \
  --env-config CrowdSim/config/env.yaml \
  --train-config CrowdSim/config/reward_model_ppo.yaml \
  --base-ppo PATH/robot_ppo_latest.pt \
  --reward-ckpt PATH/reward_model.pt \
  --headless
```
